		description:
			"I have worked on various projects, ranging from small to large. I am a Frontend Developer. In 2021, I started a YouTube channel focused on creating bots. At that time, bots were very popular, so I was curious and decided to create them. This is where I began learning programming, from Node.js, and my interest grew to the point where I wanted to create my own website. Currently, I am attending SMK NEGERI 3 METRO, majoring in Software and Game Development.",
